# Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights

🎯 Objective
As a virtual Data Visualisation Intern at Tata Insights & Quants, my role was to turn complex data sets into clear, impactful visuals that drive real business decisions. I worked on framing a business use case around underperforming units, visualizing KPIs, and recommending actions based on my findings.

🔍 Problem Statement
Tata's leadership needed clarity on key performance indicators (KPIs) across multiple business units to identify areas for operational improvement and decisions on budget reallocation. My challenge was to:

Frame a meaningful business problem
Clean and structure provided sales and operations data
Choose visualizations that tell a clear, actionable story
Present insights in an executive-friendly format
✅ My Contribution & Approach
🧹 Pre-Processing: Cleaned a multi-tabbed Excel dataset with 200+ records from retail operations
📊 Visualization Building: Created bar, pie, and trend charts for profit by category, sales trends by region, and YoY comparisons
📈 Dashboard Design: Designed a mini-dashboard with filterable tables & visual storytelling
💼 Strategy Framing: Recommended reducing investment in low-profit channels with <12% margin while increasing visibility for high-performing SKUs
📊 Key Outcomes
Identified a 36% drop in category-level profit contribution in southern regions compared to northern zones
Discovered two SKUs contributing 65% of returns despite only 9% of inventory, flagging urgent operational action
Created a business-ready visual deck to support quarterly review discussion
